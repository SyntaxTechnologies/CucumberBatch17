class 1 -
Cucumber -

Java - programming language
Selenium - automate web based application

no reports in selenium
no common ground for all the team members

no main method for execution - no control of execution

smoke
regression

framework - this is the final outcome of the complete concepts

cucumber as a tool
cucumber/BDD/gherkin as a framework

Create a new project
File -> new -> Project -> Maven -> groupId -> artifactId -> click create

group id - it means the name of the organisation
artifact id - it means the name of the project


we created maven project -
pom.xml file is the configuration file where we will add all the dependencies
pom.xml is the file we will use to execute our code in the end of the framework
pom.xml is the file we will use to generate the report

in our project we get src folder in which we get main and test

main - the code we write to develop the application, we write it in main
test - the code we write to test the application, we write it in test

we delete main folder because we will work with test

in test folder -
we get java - to keep all the java stuff
we get resources - to keep all the non java stuff

java
selenium
cucumber
apache poi
commons

Class 2 -
Recap -
in selenium, we dont have reporting option, no execution control, no standard format
of writing the code. To achieve all these, we need to integrate our scripts with
additional tools and structure (framework)

cucumber is a tool which allows us to write scenarios in plain english text called
gherkin which follows behavioral driven development.

we created maven project
we have java, selenium, cucumber, apache poi

User story - 12345 - Valid admin login

Scenario -

Given - pre condition
when - actions
Then - expected result
And - supporting tag

Given user is navigated to HRMS application
When user enters admin username and password
And user clicks on login button
Then admin user is successfully logged in

in cucumber, every single test case will be considered as a scenario

we write scenario in cucumber in a special file called feature file having the
extension .feature

rules for writing the scenario -
once step def is created, don't add any space or . or any other character into it
don't create duplicate step, you will get an exception (duplicate step exception)

cucumber highly encourages code reusability

User story - Employee search

Scenario - search employee by id

    Given user is navigated to HRMS application
    When user enters admin username and password
    And user clicks on login button
    Then user is successfully logged in
    When user clicks on PIM option
    And user clicks on Employee List Option
    When user enters employee id
    And user clicks on search button
    Then user should be able to see employee details

class 3 -

for feature file, we need step definitions to execute the code.

we need one point of execution.

as per the standards, for employeesearch feature, we need employeesearch steps class
to write all the steps definition

we cannot write duplicate steps in step definitions classes

runner class - we execute all the scenarios, some of the scenarios or one of the scenarios
based on the requirement

in runners package, we will create all the test runner classes
features
glue
dry run
tags

there is a need through which I can execute one scenario among multiple
same tag name must be provided in scenario as it is in runner class
sprint 5
sprint 1,2,3,4 - 8, 5, 7, 9
we use 'or' keyword to execute scenarios from either conditions
if one condition is true, it will execute the scenario

we use 'and' keyword to execute the scenarios when both conditions must be true

utils folder - to create common methods class so that we can use all the commmon
functions from this class

Class 4 -

recap -
test runner is a class through which we can execute all the test cases and can also control
the flow of execution.

options we add in runner class
features - path to the feature directory
glue - it provides the path of step definitions classes
dry run - to generate the missing step def, we set dry run to true.
tags - in order to execute scenarios in a group, we execute them with tags.
we use 'and' and 'or' keyword to execute based on the conditions.
we must put , in between 2 cucumber options in runner class.

as per the standards/characteristics of framework
code reusability must be there
it should be easily expandable
it should be easily understandable
new person should be able to work with it with minimal guidance
things which are used multiple places cannot be hard coded

click -
send keys -

cross browser testing - when your scripts execute against multiple browser, it is cross browser testing

we need constants class to pass the path of all the constant files such as config, testdata etc.

background - for all the common steps of the scenarios, we can write them here.
till the time flow is same, we can take the steps. Once the flow changed, we can't take steps

it is limited to one feature file. It means, for different feature files, background will be
different.

class 5 -
recap -

how to pass the data from config file -
we wrote some of the common methods in common methods class

background - common steps from all the scenarios we can take and put it under background
**only till the flow is same**

background is applicable for one feature file.

order of execution - background execute -> scenario execute

Hooks - hooks are used to write the pre condition and post condition of the project
we need to create hooks class under steps package
when we execute the code, hooks class will execute pre condition first and then all the
test cases will be executed and then post condition will execute at last

DONT FORGET TO COMMENT STEPS FROM ALL FEATURE FILES FOR PRE AND POST CONdITION

in the framework, we cannot pass any hard coded data. cucumber allows us to perform
data driven testing

data driven testing - when one scenario executed against multiple set of data, we call it
data driven testing approach

scenario vs scenario outline -
scenario execute against one set of data from the feature file
scenario outline has examples table where we keep multiple sets of data and it will
execute based on the number of data sets

order of execution -  hooks -> background -> scenario

Page object model - it is a design pattern which says that we create separate
individual class as per the screens of the application. such as for login screen
we will create loginpage class, for dashboard screen we will create dashboardpage class

we keep all the locators of the login screen in loginpage class and same we will
do for all the classes

constructor we use to initialize the object and the elements of the class
we will call selenium page factory to initialize all the elements of the class
and we call it in constructor
